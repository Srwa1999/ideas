  1. **laptop whiteboard**

    a whiteboard attached to your laptop.

    ![laptopwhiteboard2](resources/laptop-whiteboard2.jpg)

    you require only melamine, or some similar material, and velcro dots.
    pictured is some transparency paper stuck on a piece of corregated
    plastic. i've found the melamine purchased from a shop tends to not clean
    as nicely as the whiteboards you find at universities; i'm not sure why.
    recommend using these with the thin-tipped whiteboard markers.


  1. **australian budget tracker**

    somehow find out how the tax money is spent in australia, and do some sort
    of modelling on it.

    basically exists, but probably needs a bit more work:

  1. **what-now**

    looks at your timetable, and tells you what you should be doing now. will
    need to configure a timetable in some trivial json format.

    basically exists:
    - [http://taskwarrior.org](http://taskwarrior.org)

    (that is, I now use taskwarrior for this purpose.)


  1. **this file upsets me**

    you can upload the sha256 hash of a file, and then the system counts that
    file as upsetting n+1 people. list the topmost upsetting file hashes.
    never reveal the actual file contents.

    might change this to be 'how i feel about this file', and you can love it,
    or have it upset you.

  1. **git console dashboard**

    at a glance i'd like to see the status of all my repos; the
    outgoing/incoming changes from various upstream sources, etc; then i could
    issue system-wide updates and so on.

    there appear to be a few things like this, but are gui-based.
