various ideas and projects
==

these are ideas i'd like to work on, or just things i'd like to see done. if
you complete one of these things, or know some similar software, feel free to
fork and update and issue a pull request!


# incomplete

  1. **movie plot characterisation by graphs**

    this could tell you how complicated the plot is by how many nodes in the
    graph, and so on.

  1. **rotated vim screen based on head position**

    it could adjust text heights to make it appear as if you were always staring
    at it head-on. 

  1. **the inequaliser**

    takes some given equation and considers all the possible inequalities they
    could be used on it.

  1. **programming art workshopy thing**

    a place where you can go and sit and program or do art or whatever. like a
    library. would be a large open space.

  1. **do-calculus in networkx**

    implement Judea Pearls *do*-calculus in networkx.

  1. **mathematical property browser**

    suppose you have some object; you'd like to find out what you can do with
    it. for example, you might have a 'simple function'. then it could be
    measureable, say, in the context of measure theory, and so on.

    can generalise to finding various theorems (and lemmas, etc) that could be
    used in certain scenarios. should be easy to use; not at the level of
    proof assistants.

  1. **ambient sound interpreter**

    takes input from the local radio waves, converts them into sound via some
    pattern matching radom strategy. it should be possible to modify, based on
    mood, but it should also sound sufficiently unique as to be interesting.
